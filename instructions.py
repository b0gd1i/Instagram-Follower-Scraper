# 1. log into instagram on your firefox browser
# 2. run the session grabber
# 3. if the session grab was sucessful, run the follower grabber
# 4. write the name of the account that you want to get the info off. NOTE: it must be a public account, if it's private you must be a follower
# 5. wait for a bit. the code runs a bit slow so your instagram account will not get suspended for autoamtic behaviour
# 6. when the code has finished running, the paths to the files will be printed in the console
# 7. enjoy
